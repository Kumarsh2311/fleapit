            <h2>What does Fleapit do?</h2>
            <!-- <p>Wait I'll explain everything.</p> -->
            <br>
            <h3>1. Images and GIFs Searching.</h3>
            <p>
                Tired of going to your browser for searching images? Well, With fleapit you can now search image for literally anything. 
		    The command for image searching is <b>=image [keyword]</b>. For example, Lets say you want to search image of a snake, 
		    you just have to <b> =image snake </b>and the bot will send you an image of a snake. You can also just use <b> =i or =img</b> incase you are in a hurry.
		    
            </p>
            <p>
            	<strong>Note: </strong></br>
            	When you use =image/=img/=i, the images returned will be filtered. So, you don't have to be worried about getting a NSFW image.
	    <br> We have another image searching command if you want the filter to be off. Use <b>=nsfw [keyword] </b>for unfiltered images.
            	Also, the =nsfw command will only work in a NSFW discord channel.
            </p>
